## Dungeons Parts
### • Simple Room Placement
  This algorithms generates random square into a square with defined length and width,
  and make the paths between rooms.

> TO DO: Link the room between them.

### • Binary Space Partition
  The core idea of BSP is to break down a complex space (for example, a 2D or 3D environment) into smaller, more manageable regions. This division is done recursively by choosing a plane (in 3D) or a line (in 2D) that splits the space into two parts:


## • Random Map Generator
• Cellular Automata
  Generation of random pixels in the map, and according to the 8 pixels all around, change the pixel. 

• Noise
